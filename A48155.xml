            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And the good Church, in Gratitude, is to use all its Endeavours to make Mankind Slaves and Vassals to the Prerogative, and, <hi>no Bishop, no King,</hi> became once more to be the wise motto of the Government. How well the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> perform'd their Part to the Court, the suceeding Management does suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Evidence for the good Church; Immediately began to teach, that let the deportment of the Prince be what it would, the People were obliged in Conscience to pay an Intire Submission and Obedience to all his Commands; a Doctrin that is the most Pernicious and Destructive to all Humane Society, as is possible to be Introduced into the World; For this Principle has not only frequently chang'd the best of Men into the worst of Tyrants, but as often the best Constitutions into no Government, which I affirme all Tyranny to be. And this they were not only content from their <hi>Pulpits</hi> to Instil into the minds of their Auditors, but there was by that Party a Dangerous <hi>Test</hi> framed, to Swear us out of a Legal into an absolute Government.

The one having a formidable Party to encourage them in it, the other an unanimous Nation, generous enough to oppose such Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and a very slender Interest to engage them in so wicked an Attempt. However, it was pleasant enough to observe the Artifices the Good Church had recourse to, to render the generous Intentions of the late King's to the Dissenting Interest useless, and of no effect. To the King (a Lover of his own Ease) they rendred themselves impertinent, troublesom, and uneasie; to the Dissenters humble, submissive, and flattering; and not only the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the principal Laity of that Interest, but even the Sacred <hi>Verbum Sacerdotis</hi> itself was pawn'd to 'em, that in case they would consent to the annulling that Declaration in the approaching Parliament, the Good Church would sincerely use its interest to establish Liberty of Conscience by Law, though they really, as it afterward appeared, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not the least Syllable of what they pretended to. Yet they acted their part so well, That I did not much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Dissenters (a credulous People) were so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily imposed on in that matter. But no sooner was that Declaration sent down Cancelled to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but the Fanaticks paid dear enough for their Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and were severely persecuted all the remaining part of His Late Majesties Reign. And, I must ingeniously confess, I thought, in some measure, they merited it, for mistaking their true Interest, it seeming to me practicable enough at that Time, to have procur'd the Dissolution of that Long Parliament; and in a subsequent one, to have Established Universal Liberty of Conscience: Which, if obtained, the Good Church would certainly have had but little reason to have boasted either of her Numbers, or her Interest at this day. However it is the happiness of the Dissenters, that the present King has, from a Principle extremely generous and commendable, put that Interest ev'n in a time when they had not the least reason to expect it, into a state of Ease and Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, after the most Barbarous usage, it was possible to receive from the Worst of Men; Its therefore hoped at least they will now wisely consider their true Interest, and stand firmly to it, and be no more deluded by a number of Men, who, when the Government has been for <hi>Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> were always against it and ever for it, when it was Impracticable and Impossible to be obtained.
